**Crime analysis:** 

1. Heat map to show areas where more resources should be directed.
2. Maybe traffic accidents?
    * Other categories?
Vegas glitz! Clear neighborhoods/areas
Existing map of crime by zip code from Vegas PD: maybe we can borrow / improve on it?

**Dashboard**

What to manipulate/make it interactive:
Can we get unprocessed data for Vegas? Yes!
